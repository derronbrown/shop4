# Configure Spree Preferences
#
# Note: Initializing preferences available within the Admin will overwrite any changes that were made through the user interface when you restart.
#       If you would like users to be able to update a setting with the Admin it should NOT be set here.
#
# Note: If a preference is set here it will be stored within the cache & database upon initialization.
#       Just removing an entry from this initializer will not make the preference value go away.
#       Instead you must either set a new value or remove entry, clear cache, and remove database entry.
#
# In order to initialize a setting do:
# config.setting_name = 'new value'
Spree.config do |config|
  # Example:
  # Uncomment to stop tracking inventory levels in the application
  # config.track_inventory_levels = false
  #S3 configuration
=begin      #if Rails.env.production? then
           #production. Store images on S3.
           # development will default to local storage
          attachment_config = {
          s3_credentials: {
            access_key_id: 		ENV["S3_KEY"],
            secret_access_key: 	ENV["S3_SECRET"],
            bucket: 			ENV["S3_BUCKET"],
